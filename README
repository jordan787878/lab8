1. Executing an empty throw statement outside a catch handler calls
   function terminate, which abandons exception processing and terminates
   the program immediately

2. First, I think the program will run and print out "I love C++".
   But, after testing the code by writing a program.
   It turned out that the program failed and terminated.
   The problem, I found is that the compiler see 3.0 as "double type"
   rather than "float type", therefore the catch block has nothing to 
   catch and terminates the program.

   One way to fix it is th change the line " throw 3.0 " to " throw 3.0f "
   Then the catch block will succesfully get the float type and show
   out the line " I love C++ ".


3. I make a try block which new out enormous number of MinoI.
   50 loop, and each loop for 50000000 MinoI, in order to use up the 
   memory.  
   The program show that in the first three loop, is successfully new 
   out the memory. While in the forth loop, the memory is used up, thus
   cerring the Exception line: bad_alloc, which shows a memory allocating
   error happenes.

   Following is the running script.
